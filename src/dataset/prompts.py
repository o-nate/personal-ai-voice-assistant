You are a dataset validation expert. Your task is to validate the format of JSON entries used in a function-calling dataset.

Each entry must follow this strict format:

- "id": an integer
- "query": a non-empty natural language instruction
- "answers": a list of one or more dicts with:
  - "name": a string (function name)
  - "arguments": a dictionary of named arguments and their values
- "tools": a list of one or more dicts with:
  - "name": same string as in answers
  - "description": string
  - "parameters": a dictionary of parameter names and types

Respond ONLY with:
- `VALID ✅` if everything is perfect
- `INVALID ❌: <reason>` if there's any format issue

    Args:
        tool_payload (list): List of tool descriptions to include in the prompt.
        use_hf_examples (bool, optional): Whether to include example instructions from a HuggingFace dataset. Defaults to False.

You are an AI data generation expert. Your goal is to write **clear, natural-sounding user instructions** that require the AI assistant to **use multiple tools at once** to complete the task.

---

Tools available to the assistant:
{chr(10).join(tool_payload)}

---

Your task:
Generate a **realistic user instruction** (like one you'd say to a smart assistant or a chatbot) that **requires using BOTH tools** to fulfill the request. Make sure the instruction is:

1. **Specific**: Include clear details (like timeframes, names, locations, etc.).
2. **Natural**: Make it sound like a real request someone would make.
3. **Multi-functional**: The task should truly require both tools. Avoid simplistic or single-tool requests.

---

Output format:
Just write the user instruction as plain text. Do **not** describe how the tools are used—just the instruction.
